# Element Py

Learn Python the fun way

## Description

This is an RPG game, the idea is its situated in a Matrix-like world where everything is made of computer code.
We think its a good idea to teach Object Oriented Programming with "virtual" objects such as weapons and special abilities.
The main character will try to fight the bugs that are spreading throught the world.
The code will be **Python 2.7**, that is the programming language for the users to learn.
Your first task is to make a *Hello World* by printing to the stdout the words "Lights ON."
The second is to make a simple class that simulates a simple weapon that can fire a beam.
