# Element Py
Element Py is a new, engaging, and fun way to learn **Object-Oriented Python (2.7)**.

## Description
The concept of the game is simple: *write to code to survive*. From turning on the lights with a simple `print "Lights on!"` to writing custom upgrades to weapons and in-game objects, Element Py teaches the player key ideas from the basic use of the Python interpreter to inheritance and method overriding.
